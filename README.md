### Hi there 👋

I'm currently a third-year student in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences studying to become a software developer.

Programming has truly been my passion for a while now and I really like solving problems with designing and coding. I also enjoy desiging webs and seeing my work/code come to life. In addition, I am also into the analytical and mathematical approach that coding will successfully deal with practical challenges.

At the moment I'm really into full-stack web development. Most of my coding is done using TypeScript/JavaScript, Python and of course necessary HTML/CSS. 

💻 I’m currently working on: Building my portfolio of different Web and mobile applications, different interesting web projects. Mostly using React, Next.js, Node.js, Vue.js,  Express and SQL/NoSQL and Mongo DB databases.
📖 I’m currently learning: More advanced web development stuff - Auth, Websockets, SSR/SSG in Next.js and Vue.js etc.
👨‍🎓 What I want to learn next: Mobile development,  GraphQL and so many other technologies
